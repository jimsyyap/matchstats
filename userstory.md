### **User Story**

**As a tennis player,**  
I want to track my unforced errors and points won during singles or doubles matches,  
so that I can analyze my performance and improve my game over time.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **User Registration and Login:**  
   - Players and admins can create accounts and log in securely.  
   - Authentication is handled via email/password (with password hashing for security).  
   - Social login (e.g., Google, Apple) is recommended as an optional feature for convenience.  

2. **Match Creation:**  
   - Players can start a new match session by entering basic details:  
     - Opponent name (optional).  
     - Match type (singles/doubles).  
     - Date of the match.  

3. **Live Tracking:**  
   - Players manually enter their unforced errors and points won after each set or match.  
   - For doubles matches:  
     - Each player enters their own stats individually.  
     - Alternatively, players can enter team-level stats, and the app calculates per-player averages based on the final score.  

4. **Historical Data Storage:**  
   - Match stats are stored in the database and associated with the player’s profile.  
   - Players can view a history of all their matches and filter by:  
     - Date range.  
     - Match type (singles/doubles).  
     - Opponent name.  

5. **Performance Analytics:**  
   - Players can view visualizations of their performance trends over time:  
     - Line charts for unforced errors and points won over time.  
     - Bar charts comparing performance across matches.  
   - Key metrics include:  
     - Total unforced errors per match.  
     - Total points won per match.  
     - Improvement trends (e.g., reduction in unforced errors over time).  

6. **Mobile-Friendly Interface:**  
   - The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile browsers.  
   - Buttons and forms are large enough for easy tapping on small screens.  
   - A minimalistic UI with a clean layout is recommended for better usability.  
   - Dark mode is implemented as an optional theme for better accessibility.  

7. **Collaboration Features:**  
   - Players can share their stats with coaches or teammates via links or exportable reports (e.g., PDF, CSV).  
   - Social features include:  
     - Leaderboards showing top performers based on points won or lowest unforced errors.  
     - Ability to compare stats with friends or teammates.  

8. **Optional Features (Future Enhancements):**  
   - Expand tracking to include additional metrics (e.g., serves, aces, double faults, winners).  
   - Integrate wearable devices or sensors for automatic stat tracking.  
   - Add notifications for milestones (e.g., "You’ve reduced unforced errors by 10%!").

### **Technology Stack Recommendations**

#### **Frontend (React.js):**
- **UI Framework:** Use **Material-UI** or **TailwindCSS** for a modern, responsive design.  
  - Material-UI provides pre-built components and theming support, which is ideal for rapid development.  
  - TailwindCSS offers more flexibility for custom designs and is lightweight.  
- **Charting Library:** Use **Chart.js** or **Recharts** for visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar charts).  

#### **Backend (Go + PostgreSQL):**
- **Go Framework:** Use **Gin** for the backend.  
  - Gin is lightweight, fast, and has excellent support for REST APIs, making it ideal for this project.  
- **Database:** Use **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.  
  - PostgreSQL is robust, scalable, and supports advanced querying, which is useful for analytics and filtering.  
- **Authentication:** Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication.  
  - JWT is stateless and works well with REST APIs.  

#### **Additional Tools:**
- **Password Hashing:** Use **bcrypt** for securely hashing passwords.  
- **Exportable Reports:** Use libraries like **pdfmake** for generating PDF reports or **csv-writer** for CSV exports.  
- **Responsive Design Testing:** Use tools like **BrowserStack** or **Chrome DevTools** to test the app on various mobile devices.

### **Design Preferences**

1. **Minimalistic UI:**  
   - Focus on simplicity and usability. Avoid cluttered layouts.  
   - Use a consistent color scheme (e.g., green and white to align with tennis themes).  

2. **Dark Mode:**  
   - Implement dark mode as an optional theme. Use CSS variables or a library like **react-dark-mode** for easy toggling.  

3. **Responsive Design:**  
   - Ensure buttons, forms, and charts are optimized for small screens.  
   - Use media queries or CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS to handle responsiveness.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Define API Endpoints:**  
   - Create a list of REST API endpoints for user registration/login, match creation, stat tracking, and analytics.  

2. **Database Schema Design:**  
   - Design the PostgreSQL schema for storing users, matches, and stats. Include tables for:  
     - Users (id, name, email, password_hash, role).  
     - Matches (id, user_id, opponent_name, match_type, date, stats).  

3. **Prototype the Frontend:**  
   - Build wireframes or mockups for key screens (e.g., login, match creation, stat entry, analytics dashboard).  

4. **Iterative Development:**  
   - Start with core features (user auth, match tracking, analytics) and expand to include collaboration and social features later.
