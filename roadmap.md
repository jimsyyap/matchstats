     - Store match data in PostgreSQL.
   - **Frontend:**
     - Create forms for entering match details and stats.
     - Add screens for singles and doubles matches.

3. **Week 7-8: Analytics**
   - **Backend:**
     - Develop APIs to fetch historical match data and calculate performance trends.
   - **Frontend:**
     - Build a dashboard to display visualizations (e.g., line charts for unforced errors, bar charts for points won).
     - Use Chart.js or Recharts for rendering charts.

#### **Phase 3: Collaboration and Social Features (4 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Enhance the app with collaboration features like sharing stats and leaderboards.

1. **Week 9-10: Sharing Stats**
   - **Backend:**
     - Add API endpoints for exporting stats (PDF, CSV).
     - Allow users to share stats via links.
   - **Frontend:**
     - Build UI for generating and downloading reports.
     - Add options to share stats with coaches or teammates.

2. **Week 11-12: Leaderboards and Comparisons**
   - **Backend:**
     - Implement APIs for ranking players based on performance metrics.
   - **Frontend:**
     - Create leaderboards showing top performers.
     - Add functionality to compare stats with friends or teammates.

#### **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (2 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Ensure the app is stable, secure, and ready for production use.

1. **Week 13: Testing**
   - Conduct unit testing for backend APIs.
   - Perform end-to-end testing for frontend workflows.
   - Fix bugs and optimize performance.

2. **Week 14: Deployment**
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku).
   - Host the frontend on a CDN (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
   - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, New Relic) for error tracking.

---

#### **Phase 5: Future Enhancements (Ongoing)**

**Objective:** Expand the app’s functionality based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

1. **Additional Metrics Tracking:**
   - Add support for tracking serves, aces, double faults, winners, etc.

2. **Automatic Stat Tracking:**
   - Integrate wearable devices or sensors for automatic stat collection.

3. **Mobile App:**
   - Wrap the React app in React Native for a native mobile experience.

4. **Notifications:**
   - Add reminders to log stats and milestone notifications.

5. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Provide AI-driven insights (e.g., suggestions for improving performance).
